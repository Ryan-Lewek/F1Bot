You need all of these files to run the bot. If you want to change the names you are more than welcome to just make sure that you adjust the names in the main file as well.
Make sure to put in your own bot and server data.
The bot will send out a notification to the server in the channel of your choosing 15 minutes before an event or when it starts. If the event has a preshow, than the bot will make an announcement for that
when it starts as well.
The default time zone it will post in is US/Eastern, EDT, or UTC-4, you can change this to fit whatever the main timezone of your server for announcements.
To get the /nextrace function to work, the user must first provide it with a valid timezone. A list of these can be reached by using the /listtz command. This will bring you to a github page with the list of 
timezones. I do this to spare you as there are almost 600 different timezones in the library.
If a user wants to change their timezone they need only to call /settz and it replaces whatever you set as your original timezone with the new one.
